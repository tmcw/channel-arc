	  I was thinking about YouTube, where a lot of channels started off as people
	  filming from their parents houses or dorm rooms and have become full-fledged
	  professional productions. I’ll probably do a longer version of this eventually, but
	  here’s one thing: all of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee'>Marques Brownlee’s</a>
	  videos, from beginning to end. He’s an incredibly detail-oriented filmaker
	  who now is at the top rung of filmography on YouTube - using extreme high-end
	  cameras like Red &amp; advanced processing, and the highest possible HD output.
	</p>
	<p>
	  But he started in <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gk_rl3y_SU'>2009 with a HP Pavillion review and a webcam.</a>
	  These are all of his videos, in chronological order, for the first 10 seconds. You can
	  see things start to develop: gestures, improvements in lighting and framing. Title
	  cards get more compressed and perfected. It’s cool to see people mastering an art.
